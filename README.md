Extend Cron
==========================
Extend cron (e-cron) is a framework of Linux/Unix cron batch management.
It can provide single CLI batch management console for several endpoint's cron job.
Functions are as following. See detail at http://www.e-cron.org

1. [Command Line Interface]
   You can distribute same batch file to each endpoints and can watch the results at console server.
   
2. [Error handling]
   You can set error handling command for batch command failed.
   
3. [Messaging]
   You can Define job order and relation ship between endpoints, 
   then e-cron will send message to end point to start job when it meet requirements.
   
4. [Basic monitoring (CPU/Memory/Log)]

e-cron is written by light scripts and works quickly with basic unix commands.
So it will be recommended to use this framework to Linux base IoT endpoints management as well.
