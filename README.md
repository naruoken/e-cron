==========================
e-cron is a framework of Linux/Unix cron batch management.
It can provide job management console for several endpoints jobs and it can also provide error handling of batch jobs.

e-cron is written by light scripts and works quickly with basic unix commands.
So it will be recommended to use this framework to Linux base IoT endpoints as well.
